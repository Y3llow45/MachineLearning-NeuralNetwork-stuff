Small and simple projects

## Projects
**Cats and Dogs** - Convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large dataset (24k images total). <br>
The model uses convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for binary classification.

**Titanic Problem** - Machine Learning trained on a small dataset that includes each passangers age, gender, class and other. <br>
A preprocessing pipeline handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales data. The tuned RandomForestClassifier has 81% accuracy on the test set.
