Small and simple projects

## Projects
**Digit Recognition** - 6 different AI model trained to recognize hand written digits. Best model is Convolutional Neural Networks trained with enhanced data augmentation and scheduled optimzer.
Accuracy: 98.69% and test score: 9/10

**Cats and Dogs** - Convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large dataset (24k images total). <br>
The model uses convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for binary classification.

**Titanic Problem** - A machine learning model trained on a small dataset containing passenger details like age, gender, class, and more.
A preprocessing pipeline handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales the data. The tuned RandomForestClassifier achieves 81% accuracy on the test set.

**Linear Regression** - Model that uses linear regression to predict student's test score based on how many hours they studied.

**K-Nearest Neighbors** - Classification algorithm which uses Euclidean distance formula to categorize data into classes.

**Support Vector Machines** - Support Vector classification algorithm.
